The Empty Contract Benchmark consists of submitting `emptyContract` gateway transactions for the fixed-asset smart contract deployed within LevelDB and CouchDB networks. When submitting `emptyContract` gateway transactions, the interaction is recorded on the ledger. This results in the transaction pathway as depicted in Figure 1.

This is repeated for networks that use the following endorsement policies:
 
 - 1-of-any
 - 2-of-any
